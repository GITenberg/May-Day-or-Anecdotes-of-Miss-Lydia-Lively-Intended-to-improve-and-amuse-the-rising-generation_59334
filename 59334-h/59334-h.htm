<h1>MAY DAY, <i>&amp;c.</i></h1>

<h2>CHAPTER THE FIRST.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE STORY.</i></span></h2>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia Lively</i> was sitting one day
in the parlour, upon a little stool, reading
the <i>History of Little Ann and Little James</i>,
when her Mamma, who had been out
some hours on a visit, came in. The little
girl ran to her with great joy, and told
her, that her aunt had called, and had
given her the prettiest little book she ever
read.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>It is about a little girl, Mamma, just my
age; and it tells you every thing that she
did; and how well she behaved; and there
are some nice pictures in it—I wish I had
a great many such little books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Then you like to read stories about
good girls, do you, <i>Lydia</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I do; do not you, Mamma?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Yes; and to see them too. I think
there is nothing so delightful as the company
of Children who are gentle and good-humoured;
and who are cheerful and ready
to oblige, without being troublesome or
noisy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I wish I had some more stories about
good girls and boys.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Should you like to have a story written
about you, <i>Lydia</i>? Do you think it would
be a pretty one?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am afraid I am not good enough,
Mamma.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Indeed I doubt there would be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
things in the story not quite so pretty. I
suspect we should sometimes hear something
about whining for a cup of tea;
asking ten times for the same thing; or,
what is still worse, being cross and impatient
with poor little <i>Edwin</i>, if he meddle
with any of your things.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh! Mamma: but I am good sometimes;
and I am sure I always wish to be
good, and am uncomfortable whenever I
am not; but I do not know how it is,—I
think I cannot help being naughty sometimes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Pray do not fancy so my dear; you certainly
might help it; but I will tell you
the real case—you just follow your present
inclination; instead of resolving always to
do what is right, you sit down, perhaps,
with an inclination to be very good at
your lessons, and to read very well, and
translate your French very well; as long
as that inclination lasts you proceed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pleasure; but you happen to meet with
something in your books not quite so entertaining
as you expected, or a little difficult,
and then you have an inclination to fret,
or to look off your book, and complain
of being tired; or it may be, you come
into the room very good-humoured and
cheerful, and find somebody has taken your
seat, or that you cannot have the book you
wished for, and then you have an inclination
directly to whine, grumble, and draw
your lip on one side; and, I am sorry to
say, <i>Lydia</i>, you are too apt to give way to
such inclinations.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>What must I do then, Mamma?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I will tell you, my dear, you must, in
the first place, very heartily wish to be
good; and that I hope you do. In the
next place, you must, when you say your
prayers, very earnestly beg of <span class="smcap">God</span> to make
you good; and then, instead of doing just
what you have a mind to do, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
resolve with yourself, and try upon all
occasions, not to do any thing you know
is wrong, and which I have told you not
to do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Do you think, if I were to try then, I
could always be good, Madam?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Certainly! if you tried you might avoid
doing a great many wrong things. Suppose
now, when you sat down to breakfast,
and felt impatient for your tea or your
roll,—do you think, if you considered a
minute, that it is greedy and impatient
to say any thing about it, that you could
not help asking for your tea before any
body was helped, or whining if the rolls
did not come in directly; and that you
could not try to amuse yourself by thinking
of something else for a little while?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Yes; I think I could.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>To be sure you could, my dear; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in every other instance. If you do not
feel disposed to get your lessons, and do
your work at the proper times; yet if you
did but reflect how fit it is that you should
learn and improve yourself, and what a
fault idleness is, you may help fretting
and saying, I do not like to do this; and
you may resolve to keep on and do as well
as you can, without making any complaints.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am not very often naughty about reading,
Mamma?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Not very often; but that is because you
love reading; now I want you to do every
thing, because you think it is right and
fit you should do it; and then you will
do those duties you do not find any great
pleasure in, as well as those you delight
in. And above all things, I wish you to
watch constantly over your temper, to be
ever ready to oblige, and do all innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
things, because you are desired; and keep
yourself always in a good-humour.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>But sometimes things happen to tease
me, and make me fret.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Then is the time to try to get the
better of yourself; things may not always
go as you like; but nothing can make
you fret unless you will: for example, if
little <i>Edwin</i> come in and catch up your
book, or your doll, we suppose you had
rather he let them alone, but you need not
make a great noise, and whine, and call
him a naughty boy, and run and snatch
them roughly from him; you may speak
in a good-humoured tone of voice, and say,
Pray, <i>Edwin</i>, give me my book, or any
thing else he has; and if he did not attend
to that, as he is but a little boy,
you could wait quietly a little while, till
he laid it down, though you might know
you would have liked better to have it
then; and that would not be half so uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to you as putting yourself in
a passion; worrying your spirits, and making
yourself disagreeable to every body
in the room; do you think it would?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>No; I do not know that it would; for
I am never happy when I fret and scold,
nor when I have vexed you. I will try,
Mamma, if you will love me dearly.</p>

<p>Little <i>Lydia</i>, as she spoke these last
words, threw her arms round her Mamma’s
neck; her Mamma gave her a very affectionate
kiss, and then said, That I will,
my love; and as a mean to assist you in
your endeavours, I will, every evening,
after you are gone to bed, write a story
about you, to tell how you have behaved
all day; and the next morning, when we
all meet in the parlour, I will read it
aloud; and I think you will be much
better pleased with the story when you have
been a good girl, than when you have
been naughty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh! dear, Mamma! when I have been
naughty I shall not like at all to have the
story read before every body.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Then you must take a great deal of
care how you behave; you must recollect
yourself to-morrow morning when you
rise; in the evening I shall begin my
story.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE SECOND.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE SUCCESSFUL ENDEAVOUR.</i></span></h2>

<p>The next morning, Miss <i>Lydia</i>, as soon
as she waked, recollected the conversation
that had passed the day before between her
Mamma and her, and determined to be
very good all day; accordingly she jumped
out of bed as soon as the maid called
her, flood very still to be dressed; and
when she was dressed, said, Thank you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<i>Mary</i>, in a very pretty tone of voice, and
then kneeled down and said her prayers
in a very decent composed manner; and
prayed very heartily that she might be
good all day. When she met her papa
and mamma, and brothers and sisters in
the parlour, after she had bidden them all
good morning, she sat herself down very
quietly at the bottom of the table, and did
not ask for any thing, nor reach across the
table to pull the bread and butter about,
but sat still and looked very good-humoured,
till her Mamma gave her a piece
of bread with some very nice honey upon
it, and a cup of tea, and then she ate her
breakfast very genteely.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Miss <i>Lydia</i> went into
her Mamma’s dressing-room, unlocked a
little red trunk, which her Mamma had
given her a few days before, to keep her
work and her books in, and took out the
book she read in to her Mamma, which
at that time was, <i>The Footstep to Mrs. Trimmer’s
Sacred History</i>; and sitting down on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
little stool at a distance from the fire, began
to read very slowly, and in a very
easy natural tone of voice; she minded
her stops, and paid great attention to the
sense, that she might read with propriety.</p>

<p>After she had done reading English,
she carried her book away, and put it into
the trunk again, and brought her French
book, which was the second volume of
<i>La Bagatelle</i>, and translated her lesson
very readily; her next business was to
learn the Indicative mood of the verb
<i>Aimer</i>; this she found rather troublesome,
and was once or twice just going to
fret and whine; but she recollected that her
Mamma was to write an account of her,
and therefore she put on a cheerful countenance,
and took pains to learn her verb,
and said it very perfectly to her Mamma.</p>

<p>After this she took out her work, which
was a small cover for a stool she was doing
in single cross-stitch, and worked very deligently
for an hour; her Mamma then gave
her leave to go and play in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In the garden she played very quietly
and prettily, and did not run into any
dirt, but amused herself with seeing her
brother at work in his garden. She behaved
at dinner quite as well as she had
done at breakfast; and after dinner, asked
her Mamma to give her leave to put the
map of <i>Europe</i> together, which was her
usual amusement in an afternoon. Just
as she had put all the pieces exactly together,
and was beginning to tell her Mamma
the names of all the capital cities, her
little brother came running into the room,
full of play, and throwing his hat across
the table, entirely disunited all her kingdoms.
She was on the point of crying
out pretty violently, but the thought of
to-morrow’s story came into her mind,
and she only took <i>Edwin</i>’s hat gently off
the table, and said, Pray, brother, do not
throw your hat any more: see what mischief
you have done! But the little fellow
thought there was something very diverting
in seeing all the pieces fly about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and, therefore as soon as she began to put
them in order again, he again skimmed his
hat across the table. Three times
she attempted to settle the affairs of <i>Europe</i>,
and as often Master <i>Edwin</i> deranged
them. The little girl then, with
great good-humour, put the pieces into
the box, and said to her Mamma, <i>Edwin</i>
is in such a wild humour, that I think I
had better put the box away till he is gone.
No, my dear, said her Mamma, he shall
not tease you any more. I had a mind to
give you an opportunity of showing how
good you could be; and now he shall not
interfere with you again: so calling the
little boy, his Mamma told him, if he did
not let his sister’s things alone, he must be
sent out of the room; she then gave him
a box of ivory letters to amuse him.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> continued to behave quite
well till she went to bed. Not being in
the least troublesome, by making a noise,
or worrying for books or play-things which
were not at hand; but employing herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with such things as she met with, without
being in any body’s way. You may be
sure that she went to-bed very happy at
night; and that her Papa and Mamma
took a very affectionate leave of her.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE THIRD.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE RELAPSE.</i></span></h2>

<p>The following day, at breakfast, Miss
<i>Lydia</i> had the pleasure of hearing her
Mamma read this account of her very
pretty behaviour, and saying, that she had
been quite good all day; which of course
made her extremely happy. For several
days <i>Lydia</i> went on in the same charming
manner: never was idle at her tasks, impatient
at her meals, nor peevish at her
play; and her Mamma began to hope,
that she had quite corrected all her faults.
Sorry, however, am I to say, that she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not persevere in being so regularly good.
After a short time she began to grow a
little tired of taking pains with herself.
The first time she forgot herself was when
she was reading her French lesson. Having
finished <i>La Bagatelle</i>, her Mamma gave
her <i>Chambaud’s French Fables</i>, showed her
the Dictionary at the end, and instructed
her how to find out any word she wanted.
This was rather difficult at first, but in a
few days would have grown easy to her;
however she wanted resolution to take a
little pains, and began fretting and grumbling
sadly. Her Mamma said, Recollect
yourself, <i>Lydia</i>; this will not make a pretty
story: and, taking the book, would very
kindly have assisted her to look for the
word <i>Pierre</i>; which was what she happened
to want; but <i>Lydia</i> turned her head
on one side, and made up a sad dismal
face. Her Mamma then laid the book
on the table, and took no further notice,
but went out of the room. She staid
some little time, and when she came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
again found little <i>Lydia</i> sitting very sorrowfully
in the corner of the room. She
was ashamed to look at her Mamma or
to speak a word; the thoughts of having
disgraced herself, after having set out
with so much credit, and been so good for
almost a week, grieved her very much;
and she would have given any thing in the
world to have had the last half hour to
spend over again.</p>

<p>After a silence of near a quarter of an
hour, her Mamma said to her, What are
you thinking of <i>Lydia</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am thinking, Mamma, how foolish I
shall look, and how ashamed I shall be to-morrow
morning, when you read this
naughty story of me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Really, my dear, I shall not feel less
ashamed nor concerned than you; and I
was in great hope, after you had experienced
the comfort of being good, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would not have again relapsed into your
old faults.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am sure, Mamma, this morning I did
not think I should ever have been naughty
again. What must I do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I hope the feeling so foolish and ashamed
as you say you shall do, on hearing this
account read, will prevent your behaving
so again. Endeavour now to make
amends for your fault, by taking great
pains with your lesson. There is the
book, now find <i>Pierre</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> did as she was bidden; and got her
lesson very well, and behaved pretty well
the rest of the day, though not quite so
pleasingly as she had done some days before:
for the thought of her misbehaviour
had hurt her spirits, and inclined her to be
a little fretful and whining.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE FOURTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE GENEROUS CONFESSION.</i></span></h2>

<p>The meeting at breakfast, you may suppose,
was not a very pleasant one to Miss
<i>Lydia</i>. Her Mamma, however, after reading
the account of her fault, added, that she
had acknowledged herself truly sorry and
ashamed of it, and had learned her lesson
very diligently; and then embracing her,
said, she dared say she should never be
obliged to put her to the blush again.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> now began the day with
again trying to be very good; but not
with half the spirit and cheerfulness that
she had done before her fault; and in the
course of the three or four next weeks
she was very frequently off her guard.
However she persevered in striving to be
good, and often, when she had begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
speak crossly, or be idle, or argue with her
Mamma, she would recollect herself, and
stop short at once, and running to her
Mamma, say, My dear Mamma do kiss
me, and then I will be good. Acting thus,
she became less and less apt to offend, and
many days passed without one unpleasant
story to tell.</p>

<p>It happened, however, one day, when
she and her little brother were in the garden,
that he took off the bench a nosegay
she had just been tying up, with an intention
of presenting it to her Mamma. She
ran with some eagerness to take it from
him; but the little fellow was tenacious
of it; upon which she grew angry, and
a contest ensued; at last, in a passion, she
took hold of the tops of the flowers, and
pulled them all to pieces, and threw her
brother down by her violence. <i>Edwin</i>
began crying; and she, who loved him
dearly, forgot all her anger immediately,
begged his pardon for having thrown him
down, and asked, whether he was hurt? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
few kisses and another flower soon made it
up with little <i>Edwin</i>, and this quarrel passed
over without being observed by any body,
and had really been forgotten by Miss
<i>Lydia</i> till she went to-bed.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i>, though she was not always free
from faults, was a child of remarkable
honour; and could not bear the thoughts,
in any way, of deceiving any one. She
could not, therefore, suffer her Mamma
to say she had been good all day, when
she felt so conscious of the contrary; and
went, as soon as she was dressed, to confess
the whole truth. As she passed the window,
she saw a lady, for whom she had a
particular respect, coming in, and as she
well knew, to breakfast with her Mamma.
This was a sad mortification to her: however,
she went on into her Mamma’s
room, and upon being asked, what the
dog barked at, told her Mamma, Miss
<i>Hipkins</i> was come to breakfast with her.
She then stood by the window considering
how she should begin to speak to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Mamma. Her affectionate mother, having
watched her countenance, said, You
look grave and perplexed, <i>Lydia</i>; I suppose
you are thinking of the journal; but
do not be alarmed, my love, I have not
one fault to mention, and Miss <i>Hipkins</i>
will rejoice to hear you are grown so good
a girl. O! Mamma! said the dear girl,
I cannot deceive you, nor receive praises
I do not deserve. She then told all that
passed between her and <i>Edwin</i> in the
garden.</p>

<p>I have been very naughty, Mamma, said
<i>Lydia</i>, and I shall be very much ashamed
to hear it told; but I should be still more
ashamed to be fondled and commended,
while I thought, that if you knew as much
of me as I do of myself, you would behave
in a very different manner to me.
Her Mamma caught her in her arms in a
transport of affection, and said, May God
for ever bless you, my dear child; and
preserve to you that sincerity and singleness
of heart which are so precious in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
sight! Look up, my love; I shall relate
your fault; but the story of your voluntary
confession will reflect more honour
upon you, than if no fault had been committed:
and every thing may be hoped
of a young person with so noble a disposition.—Come,
let us go down.</p>

<p>A few days after this amiable behaviour
of Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s, her Mamma received a
letter to appoint a day for the arrival of
some company, who were to stay a fortnight,
and whom Miss <i>Lydia</i> had never
seen.</p>

<p>On the evening on which they were to
come, Miss <i>Lydia</i> joined her Mamma as
she was walking alone in the garden, and,
after some hesitation, said, she had a favour
to beg of her, which was, that no
stories might be read about her while the
company staid.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Why not, my dear?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>If I should happen to be naughty, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
shall be so ashamed to hear it told before
strangers!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Then you will have an additional motive
to be attentive to your conduct; and
surely you would submit to any method
that is likely to make you good.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>But to have every body know how
naughty one is——</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>You seldom do wrong without being
observed by somebody, and generally by
more persons than you are aware of.—I
speak after the common manner of speaking.—But
to be more serious, there is a
constant witness, <i>Lydia</i>—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I know, Mamma—God always sees
me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>And is He not more to be feared than
all the world put together? both because
He is more able to punish you, and because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
as He is the greatest of beings, it is
more disgrace to appear dishonourable in
His sight than in that of all the creatures
He has made. But that is not all; you
seem to dread that “Every body should
know how naughty you are.”—Be careful
then. There will come a day when
all the men that ever were in the world,
and all the angels that are in heaven, will
be assembled together: and all those who
have been wicked will have their sins proclaimed
before this assembled multitude,
and be disgraced before them all. Beware
then, my child, of real offences, and
watch now so continually over your behaviour,
that, by correcting, while you
are so young, all your little faults, you may
be happily preserved from falling into
such serious ones as will cover you with
shame and confusion at that awful day.</p>

<p>Here they were interrupted by the arrival
of all the company; but her mother’s
words sunk deep into Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s
mind, and from that time she was doubly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
careful of all her behaviour. During the
whole fortnight that the company staid,
she had no cause to regret the journal’s
being produced. From that time, it was
very seldom that any error of consequence
was mentioned in it.</p>

<p>After having gotten the better of some
bad habits she had contracted, she daily,
by an attention to her Mamma’s advice,
improved in every grace and accomplishment.
The good-will with which she,
applied to her different tasks, occasioned
her making a great progress in them: and
her constant good-humour and composedness
of temper made her look always
pretty and engaging. Her Mamma was
so charmed with the sweetness of her behaviour,
which was free from all noise,
rudeness, or turbulence, that she studied
every way in her power to indulge and
gratify her; and if ever she was refused
any thing, she knew it was because it was
not fit for her; and, therefore, never
asked nor wished about it again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE FIFTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>BENEVOLENCE ENCOURAGED.</i></span></h2>

<p>About a month or two after Miss
<i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma had begun to write an
account of her behaviour, the little girl
was playing with a few companions at a
bench close by the garden-gate. Her
Papa had made her a present of a small
basket of cherries out of the hot-house,
and the little girls were amusing themselves
with tying them on sticks, as the
fruiterers do when they first bring them to
market.</p>

<p>While they were thus employed, a little
girl very tidily dressed walked by, leading
by the hand her brother, who appeared
between two and three years old. The
girl’s attention was taken by the sight of
the fruit at so early a season, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
little boy, who thought they looked nice,
though he did not know what they were,
said, Look, <i>Sally</i>!—<i>gapes</i>! The girl
did not speak nor give offence to any
body; but one of the Misses, whose pride
predominated over her good-nature, asked
her, in a haughty tone of voice, What she
wanted? and bade her not be so impertinent
as to stand staring at them. The
little girl moved on directly; but the
poor little boy pulled from her, and said,
in a crying tone of voice, <i>Gapes!</i> I want
<i>gapes</i>! This produced a second huffing
from the same Miss; who said, Get you
gone, you little monkey. His sister then
immediately took him away.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i>, who was much hurt at her
friend’s behaviour, said, How could you
speak so crossly to the poor little things?
why should not they love fruit as well as
we; and more too, as it must appear a
greater rarity? She then went out at the
gate, and stepping after the little children,
put into the little boy’s hand a stick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cherries which she had just tied up.
There, little boy, said she, these are not
grapes; they are cherries: when you have
played with them a little while you must
give your sister half. Yes; said he, I always
give sister half—Look, <i>Sally</i>!</p>

<p>But you should say, Thank you, Miss,
said <i>Sally</i>, making a pretty courtesy; and
do not pull them off till you have shown
them to my mammy: they are so pretty!</p>

<p>Little <i>Lydia</i> felt pleased and very comfortable
after she had done this good-natured
action; and she could not help
being conscious that her Mamma would
have approved of her for it; but she knew
too well what was right and becoming to
tell of it herself, or even to give a hint of
it; for though nothing gave her so much
pleasure as her mother’s commendations,
yet she knew that a good action loses all
its beauty when it is done for the sake of
any reward whatever. Her behaviour,
however, did not pass unobserved, for
the maid, who was walking in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with a baby in her arms, saw the whole
transaction, and was so delighted with it,
that when she went to dress her mistress,
she told her how sweetly Miss <i>Lydia</i> had
behaved. Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma, however,
took no notice at all to her of it. Think
what was the dear girl’s surprise in the
morning, when she heard the whole story
read aloud in her Mamma’s journal; and
think what pleasure she received from
praises so well deserved as those which
were bestowed upon her. Her Mamma
inquired of her whether she knew the little
girl’s name, or where she lived? she answered,
No, Mamma: she looked very
clean and neat, Mamma; but I observed
that she had no tippet, nor any thing to
keep her neck from the sun; and the little
boy’s toes came through his shoes. If
you please, I will give her the garden
shawl I have just left off; and I think
those red shoes, which are too little for
<i>Edwin</i>, will fit the little boy. Then you
shall have the pleasure of giving those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
things to them, said her Mamma; you
may ask <i>Mary</i> for them, and I have a bit
of check by me, which I will cut into an
apron, and you shall make it for the little
girl; <i>Mary</i> says she is about your height.—<i>Lydia</i>
did not forget the permission she
had. The shawl and shoes were laid carefully
by, and with them a paper of almonds
and raisins, which she had bought
with her own money.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i>, with great pleasure, set about the
task proposed to her, and worked with
great neatness and expedition upon the
apron. Miss <i>Stark</i> happening to come in
when she was at work, expressed great
surprise at her employment, and said, she
wondered her Mamma should let her wear
the skin off her pretty little fingers with
such coarse, nasty work, which was much
fitter for the maid than for her; and that
she thought it much below her to be
making checked aprons for a poor girl.</p>

<p>When Miss <i>Stark</i> was gone, <i>Lydia</i> told
her Mamma what she had said to her. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
must not, said her Mamma, suffer Miss
<i>Stark</i> to visit you, if she puts such notions
into your head. Can it possibly be below
you to be useful to any person living?
Your pretty little fingers, as she calls
them, were given you to be of use; and
though she employs hers only at the
harpsichord, yet I think they should often
be exercised in plain and profitable works.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I like to work sometimes, Mamma.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>It is very proper you should. Never,
especially, my dear girl, be above working
for the poor, and doing them every
service in your power: little girls have
seldom much money, their very cloaths are
given them; the only thing they have of
their own is their time: if they give up
some of their play-hours to work for a
poor neighbour, they strengthen good dispositions
and habits in themselves, and do,
perhaps, the only act of charity in their
power. You had no apron to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
little girl, so I let you work at this, that
you might have the pleasure of making
it by that mean your own present; and I
hope, that during the whole of your life,
you will find it one of your greatest
pleasures to do good and kind actions.
Miss <i>Stark</i> would, I think, be ashamed of
talking so, if she ever read her bible, or
considered who has laboured so much for
the poor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Miss <i>Stark</i>’s Mamma gives her a great
deal of money, and I believe she often
gives some of it away.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I do not know that she wants good nature;
but she puts herself to no inconvenience
by giving away money, when she
can go and get more of her Mamma the
first time she wants a toy; and she would
show much more real charity, if she wore
less finery, or spent a little less time in
diversion, for the sake of being serviceable
to the poor sometimes. Charity, my dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
means love to our neighbour; and we are
most sure that love is sincere when we
part with something we like, or give
ourselves some trouble to serve them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Then, Mamma, instead of going into
the garden this afternoon, I will finish
the apron; at present I am very tired,
and must go and take a run.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE SIXTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE MAY GARLAND.</i></span></h2>

<p>Though <i>Lydia</i> watched very anxiously,
a day or two passed before she saw
the little folk again; one day, however,
as she was sitting at the window, she saw
them coming, she flew down stairs, and,
met them just as they were going by the
gate; in her haste to catch them she had
run down without the presents; she, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
desired them to stop a minute, and
going up stairs again, soon returned with
the shawl, the shoes, the apron, and the
almonds and raisins. She made the two
children very happy by her gifts, particularly
the boy, who said, Thank you, and
cried, Shoes! shoes! twenty times over.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> made him sit down on the bench
whilst his sister put them on, and observing
he had but one shoe-string, ran in to ask
for a bit of ribbon. <i>Mary</i> gave her a
very nice bit of black ribbon, long
enough to tye both shoes, and sent
the young folk away much delighted;
though the dressing them took up her attention
so much, that she forgot to ask
their names, or where they lived. Many
days had passed, and <i>Lydia</i> had almost
forgotten the little girl and boy, when
one morning she arose early, very cheerful
with the consciousness of having behaved
well the preceding day; and as the
sun shone, and it was very pleasant, she put
on her hat, handkerchief, and gloves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
walked into the garden before breakfast:
she had not walked long before she saw
something held up at the gate that looked
very pretty; she went that way to see what
it was, and soon knew the little girl and
boy to whom she had been so kind.
They held between them a garland made
of all sorts of pretty flowers, tied with bits
of ribbon; What have you there? said
<i>Lydia</i>; I never saw such a pretty thing
before! It is a present for you, Miss,
said <i>Sally</i>, if you will please to accept of
it: to day is <span class="smcap">May Day</span>, and my mother
and I got up at four o’clock this morning
to make the garland. My mother had several
good friends who gave her leave to
gather flowers in their gardens, and some
ladies gave her bits of ribbon; we have
taken a great deal of pains to make it,
and I hope you will like it.</p>

<p>The delight of <i>Lydia</i> is not to be expressed;
she thanked the little girl in a
very civil pretty manner, and then ran,
half wild with pleasure, into her Mamma’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
room, to show her prize. It is very
handsome, indeed, my dear, said her
Mamma, the child’s mother has shown a
very grateful attention. But you should
make the little girl some present; for
though I dare say that was not her mother’s
view in sending the garland, yet it is
usual on May Day.—Run down with this
shilling.</p>

<p>Away flew little <i>Lydia</i>; but she was too
late. The children had been strictly
charged not to stay at all, for fear it
should seem as if they expected any
thing; and if any money were offered
them, to refuse it very civilly, and say,
their mother would be very angry if they
took it.</p>

<p>The joy of the garland had still prevented
any inquiry about their name or
place of abode; but Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma
was so pleased with this instance of delicate
civility in their mother, that she took pains
to learn who she was, and found that her
name was <i>Brush</i>; that she was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
worthy and industrious woman, who kept
a little school, and took in needle-work.
Miss <i>Lydia</i>, after showing her garland with
great delight in the parlour, hung it up
in the nursery; and at every interval of
leisure, during the day, came to admire it,
and to play with it.</p>

<p>In the morning as soon as Miss <i>Lydia</i>
arose, she went to look at her garland; but
to her great mortification saw that all its
beauty was gone; that the tulips hung
their heads, that the other flowers were
withered, and their colours faded; with
some concern she went to her Mamma,
to show her the change in her garland.
My dear moppet, said she, had you forgotten
that flowers would wither? they
draw all their nourishment from the earth,
and, therefore, when they are separated
from it they must die.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>How can the earth nourish them,
Mamma?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>My dear, as the food you take nourishes
you, so the plant draws the moisture out
of the earth, and that moisture runs
through all the parts of it, and supports
it; and according to the different channels
it runs through, takes all kinds of beautiful
colours, or sometimes only a fine green;
and in some flowers takes no colour at all,
but leaves the plant a pure white. The
earth is called the parent of plants and
vegetables; and it supports them as a
mother does her child: if the flower be
taken out of the ground, it withers as these
have done; and what would little <i>Joseph</i>
or even you do, <i>Lydia</i>, if you were taken
from me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>You told me once that God took care
of me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Certainly; and without the help of God
neither could the earth nourish its plants,
nor the mother protect her child; but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
general, he is pleased to convey support
and blessings to the child, through the
means of the parents; and as they delight
in being made the instruments of his
goodness to their child, it ought to inspire
the child with tender affection and gratitude
towards them, and incline it to obey
the commands of God:</p>

<p>“Honour thy father and thy mother.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am sure, Mamma, I love you; and
you are very good to me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>And I have the pleasure of telling you,
you were very good yesterday; for when
I called you to your lesson, though you
were deeply engaged in examining your
garland, you asked <i>Mary</i> to hang it up,
and came directly. I design, as a reward,
to take you, after business is done, to see
Mrs. <i>Brush</i> and her young family; and, if
you can find any little books to carry, I
dare say they will be a very welcome present.
I shall take some of the <i>Short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Lectures for the use of Sunday schools</i>,
and the <i>Catechism divided into sentences</i>.</p>

<p>This promise gave much delight to Miss
<i>Lydia</i>, and encouraged her to get her lessons
with great diligence.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE SCHOOL ROOM.</i></span></h2>

<p>The morning business being finished,
Miss <i>Lydia</i> and her Mamma set out, accompanied
by little <i>Edwin</i>. They found
the good woman in an exceedingly neat,
comfortable room, surrounded by a number
of little forms, on which sat about
twenty very orderly children, among
whom were her own little boy and girl.
The little girl was marking a sampler, and
the little boy looking at the alphabet in a
spelling-book. At the sight of the lady
and her children, they all rose up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mrs. <i>Brush</i> would have sent them away,
as school was almost done; but Miss
<i>Lydia</i> and her Mamma both begged they
might sit down again. They looked at their
works, examined their books, and Miss
<i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma asked Mrs. <i>Brush</i> many
questions about her own children, and her
scholars, while the little girl was very
busy looking over <i>Sally</i>, and seeing her
make words upon her sampler. <i>Edwin</i>
employed himself in admiring a parrot
which hung in the corner of the room, and
which repeated b, a, ba, c, a, ca, d, a, da,
and so on, as he had learnt by hearing the
children; and was indeed an apter scholar
than some of them. Upon a hint from
her Mamma, Miss <i>Lydia</i> presented to Mrs.
<i>Brush</i> the books she had brought, which
were <i>The good Child’s Delight</i>, <i>Short Conversations</i>,
and <i>Familiar Dialogues</i>, together
with the books before-mentioned, which
her Mamma had brought.</p>

<p>For the little girl Miss <i>Lydia</i> reserved
<i>First Principles of Religion</i>, a book which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
her Mamma esteemed very highly indeed,
and preferred to any other book of the
kind, but which she did not put into her
hands till she had altered some few passages;
which, though written with the
best intention in the world, appeared to
her to speak of the Deity in words too
free to be put even into the mouth of an
ignorant child. <i>Lydia</i> had not forgotten
the little boy, to whom she gave the
<i>Universal Shuttlecock</i>. You may be sure
these presents were received with many
thanks; and Mrs. <i>Brush</i> afterwards asked
her visiters to walk in her garden, showed
them a nice brood of chickens, and gave
Miss <i>Lydia</i> some cabbage to feed two rabbits
that were in a hutch: she then took
them to her bee-hives, where the little
bees were all in a cluster at the door, or
buzzing about and sipping sweetness out
of the flowers, to make honey for their
winter provision.</p>

<p>I have heard my sister, said <i>Lydia</i>, repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some verses about killing the poor
bees and taking their honey.</p>

<p>I do not kill them Miss, said Mrs.
<i>Brush</i>, I have been taught to use some
fumes which will stupify them for a time,
and then I take their honey, only leaving
them a little to live upon, and they soon
revive; and if, in the winter, when there
are no flowers, I cannot spare them honey
enough, I feed them with sugar and water.
The greatest part of my honey I have
sold; but when we go in, if you please,
you shall taste the remainder.</p>

<p>The young people were permitted to
take a little of the offered honey, which
was nicely spread on a thin bit of home-baked
bread. The lady made a present
of some money to the good woman, and
they then took their leave of Mrs. <i>Brush</i>
and the children.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE LITTLE LAMB.</i></span></h2>

<p>About a week after the visit to the
school, <i>Lydia</i>, from her window, saw <i>Sally</i>
lugging something under her arm, which
seemed more than she could manage,
when the little girl came to the gate, she
stopped and looked in, but modesty prevented
her from ringing. Miss <i>Lydia</i>,
went down to see what she wanted: but
how surprised was she to see that <i>Sally</i>’s
load was a little lamb, not many days old.
It had been given to <i>Sally</i> by a farmer,
whose little boy and girl went to school
to her mother, because the dam was dead;
and she had adorned its neck with a wreath
of field flowers, and brought it as a present
to Miss <i>Lydia</i>; accordingly when
<i>Lydia</i> came to the gate, she, in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pretty manner, begged her acceptance of
it, and told her it must be fed two or
three times a-day with warm milk. Nobody
can express the delight of Miss
<i>Lydia</i>, upon finding herself mistress of
the lamb. Her joy, however, did not
make her forget to thank <i>Sally</i> with great
good-nature and civility for the gift; nor
did it prevent her recollecting that her
mother had thought it proper to offer
her a present for the May garland, she,
therefore, begged her to stay till she
showed the lamb to her Mamma; and
taking it up, tottered into the house; she
soon returned with half a crown, which,
she took great pains to persuade <i>Sally</i> to
accept, but to no purpose: she said, her
mother would be very angry with her if
she took any thing; that the lamb had
cost her nothing, and she had been strictly
charged to take nothing for it.</p>

<p>Then, said Miss <i>Lydia</i>, at least let me
give you some fruit and some cake; and
taking the little girl by the hand, seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
her upon a bench, and ran to fetch her a
piece of cake; then, with her Mamma’s
leave she gathered for her some strawberries
and cherries. <i>Sally</i> thanked her very
prettily, and begged leave to carry them
home to divide with her brother; thus
having given the little lamb a kiss, and
again told Miss <i>Lydia</i> it must be fed with
warm milk, and be taken into the house
at night, she went away.</p>

<p>You may believe that the greatest part
of <i>Lydia</i>’s employment was to feed and
tend the little lamb, whose baaing would
indeed have excited tenderness even in a
heart of less sensibility than <i>Lydia</i>’s.</p>

<p>The pleasure she had in the lamb, naturally
led her to think and talk of the
little giver. <i>Lydia</i> observed to her Mamma,
that although <i>Sally</i> was a poor girl,
and had never gone into company, yet
she always behaved in a very pretty manner,
and spoke gently and civilly, and
made charming courtesies.</p>

<p>My dear, said her mamma, when people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have a modest opinion of themselves, and
wish to behave with respect and civility,
they seldom do any thing that is improper.</p>

<p>A fear of offending will make them
gentle and reserved in their behaviour;
and a person who tries to speak in an
obliging manner is not often at a loss for
language. It is conceit and forwardness
which make people disgusting; and conceit
and forwardness are as disagreeable in a
little girl or boy, if their parents are rich
as if they were poor. Nothing can make
children agreeable, but being humble and
tractable, and behaving in an obliging,
respectful manner to every body; for as
children, whoever their parents be, can
know very little, and are unable to say any
thing worth hearing, they should, therefore,
think every body of more consequence
than themselves, and be very
much obliged to any body who takes notice
of them. I am sure, said <i>Lydia</i>, I think
myself so. You always appear to think so,
my dear, said her Mamma; our friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
are very kind to you, and will continue
so while you behave as properly as you
do; but whenever children begin to argue
with grown people, speak pertly to them,
like Miss <i>Smart</i>, or pretend to know better
than they do, what is right and proper,
they become very ridiculous and very disagreeable.
What pleases you in <i>Sally</i>, and
what will equally please in yourself is,
that she seems to have no wish nor will
but to oblige you, and to do what she
thinks may please you, and show her respect
to you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE NINTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE WORK BAGS.</i></span></h2>

<p>During the course of the summer, Miss
<i>Lydia</i>’s aunt found it necessary to take a
long journey, and desired the favour to
leave her little daughter in her sister’s
family during her absence, as it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
convenient to take her. This little girl,
whose name was <i>Fanny</i>, was about <i>Lydia</i>’s
age; and, therefore, though Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s
elder sisters were very obliging and good-natured
to her, yet she was her chief
companion, and was very much delighted
with her society. One day, a lady, who
was very intimate in the family, came
to make a visit, and brought a present
to each of the little girls of a silk work-bag
trimmed with broad lace. In the
bag were a needle book furnished with
thread and needles, a silver thimble, a
pair of scissors with silver tops in a nice
red sheath; and beside, a piece of drawn
lawn neatly tacked upon a bit of oil-skin,
and just begun for them, that they
might each work for herself a tucker.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Fanny</i> though very good-natured,
was exceedingly giddy and careless, leaving
her dolls, books, and every thing she had,
scattered all over the house; the consequence
of which was, that they were frequently
lost or spoiled. This lady, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
knowing her failing, gave her a particular
caution to take care of her work-bag;
and desired, when the young ladies
came to see her, they would each bring
their bag with them.</p>

<p>For some little time <i>Fanny</i> continued
very mindful of the advice which had
been given her. One day they had been
working in a little summer-house in the
garden, and Miss <i>Fanny</i> had been particularly
guarded, by one of the elder
young ladies, against leaving her work-bag,
when she came in.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i>, when she had done work,
collected all her things into her bag, and
hung it upon her arm, <i>Fanny</i> did the
same, and they both came down out of the
summer-house; but <i>Fanny</i> said, she must
gather a nosegay before she came in, out
of a little garden that had been given her,
and away she ran to the place; but finding
the work-bag inconvenient upon her
arm when she stooped to gather flowers,
she laid it down on a clean grass plot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
nosegay being made, she was preparing to
go in, when she saw <i>Lydia</i>’s little lamb,
who was in the adjoining field, put his
nose over the pales very near her; she
ran to him, stroked his head, fetched him
some cabbage to eat out of her hand,
and played with him, till recollecting she
should scarce have time to be dressed before
dinner, she ran in, in great haste,
leaving the work-bag upon the grass.
<i>Fanny</i> did not once think of her work-bag
till she was going to sit down to
work after dinner; she then recollected
that she had left it upon the grass, and
ran in great haste to fetch it; but when
she came she found all her things in a
very dismal condition; the work-bag was
torn to pieces, and all wet and dirty; the
needle book and work were tossed out, and
entirely spoiled; the thimble had rolled
quite away; in short nothing had escaped
but the scissors, and, as for the sheath that
was bent, and the colour quite changed.
Any of you who ever have had a present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
you were pleased with, and seen it destroyed
by your own carelessness, will be able
to judge what this little girl felt, when she
cast her eyes upon all this mischief. She
stood at first quite stupified, then began
to examine the things one by one, and
when she found them entirely spoiled, she
could not refrain from tears and lamentation.
The gardener, hearing her cry,
came from the other end of the garden, to
know what was the matter? she told him
her misfortunes, and asked, who could
have put her things into that state? The
gardener said, it was a great pity, but he
did not doubt but it was the puppy, for he
had just before seen him running about
the garden, and had turned him out.</p>

<p>Poor <i>Fanny</i> could do nothing but pick
up the tattered bits, and carry them sorrowfully
into the house; even those who
blamed her negligence could not help
pitying her; and she found Miss <i>Lydia</i>, in
particular, ready to cry with her, and to
share in her trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, as <i>Lydia</i> and her
little friend were talking over this accident,
<i>Fanny</i> said, her greatest concern was,
that Mrs. <i>Grant</i> would know she had
taken so little care of her present; and
that she could not bear the thought of seeing
her; but, says she, one of the maids
told me, she had got a piece of blue
silk just the colour of mine, and she had
a cousin who was a miliner, and would
give her a bit of blond lace and ribbon,
and she would make me a bag and
needle-book, just like the others; and
that I might buy a sheath with my own
money; and if we could but find the
thimble, Mrs. <i>Grant</i> need never know it;
for, as your Mamma was out all day yesterday,
and does not come home till to-morrow,
she need know nothing of the
matter; and who else will tell? It may
be very good-natured in <i>Sarah</i>, said Miss
<i>Lydia</i>; but I hope, my dear <i>Fanny</i>, you
are too good to do such a mean, deceitful
trick; if, you say, you could not bear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
see Mrs. <i>Grant</i> now, I think it must distress
you a great deal more to see her
when you knew you were trying to deceive
her; and how dreadful it would be
to hear her commend you for taking such care
of your bag, when you were conscious
how you have behaved. I am sure, if no
creature were to find me out, I should be
very miserable; and if you should be
found out, what would become of you
then?</p>

<p>You are a great deal better than I am,
said <i>Fanny</i>; and now I consider about it,
I dare say my Mamma would be very
sorry I should do so; and so I must tell
Mrs. <i>Grant</i> the whole truth, I think—but
I shall look so foolish!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE TENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE VISIT.</i></span></h2>

<p>Sometime after the loss of the work-bag,
the family received an invitation to
dine at Mrs. <i>Grant</i>’s. On the day they
were to go, Miss <i>Lydia</i> took an opportunity
of seeing her Mamma alone, and
asking her advice. I do not like, Mamma,
said she, to take my work-bag with
me, because I think it will mortify poor
<i>Fanny</i> so, and look as if I wanted to show
I was more careful than she; and yet I
am afraid of appearing uncivil to Mrs.
<i>Grant</i>, who desired me to bring it.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> received her Mamma’s tenderest
caresses, and commendations, for her sentiment
and generosity; you judge with
great propriety and delicacy, my dear, as
to not taking the work-bag; and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<i>Grant</i>, who must know the history of poor
<i>Fanny</i>’s, will easily guess your reason for
leaving yours at home, and will honour
you for it; and <i>Fanny</i>, when she knows
how kind and considerate you are, must
love you dearly. The coach was soon
after at the door, and Miss <i>Lydia</i>, her
Mamma, one of her sisters, and <i>Fanny</i>
got in.</p>

<p>Poor <i>Fanny</i> was that day an instance
how one giddy or thoughtless thing may
entirely destroy a person’s pleasure. She
had been expecting the day they were to
go to Mrs. <i>Grant</i>’s with great impatience
and delight; but her unfortunate carelessness
had so altered her feelings, that
she dreaded the thought of going, and
would very gladly have been left behind.
She was very grave all the way, though
<i>Lydia</i> tried all she could to amuse her, by
pointing out to her the flowers in the
hedges, the birds in the trees, and the
carriages as they passed, Mrs. <i>Grant</i> was
very happy to see them all, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the two young ones. She observed them,
however, a little, to see if they had brought
their work-bags.</p>

<p>The young ladies, as they were seating
themselves, observed upon a table, at the
farther end of the room, two very little
cradles with dolls in them; they thought
it probable they were intended as a present
for them; and this thought increased
poor Miss <i>Fanny</i>’s distress and confusion:
to receive another present when she had
been so careless of the former, hurt every
generous principle within her; after some
little time, Mrs. <i>Grant</i> asked Miss <i>Lydia</i>
if she had done her tucker? <i>Lydia</i> answered
very modestly and prettily, Yes,
Madam.</p>

<p>And why did you not then bring it to
show me? I dare say it is very nicely
done; and I had pleased myself much
with the thoughts of seeing both your
works: is yours finished too, Miss <i>Fanny</i>?
Poor <i>Fanny</i> could hold out no longer, but
burst into tears. Her aunt was so good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as to explain to Mrs. <i>Grant</i> the cause of
her grief, and tell how very sorry she had
been: she likewise informed her of <i>Lydia</i>’s
delicacy in not chusing to make a parade
of her work-bag, which was, however,
very safe at home.</p>

<p>You are a sweet girl, said Mrs. <i>Grant</i>,
and will, I dare say, make an excellent
nurse; she then fetched the two cradles;
they are both of white sattin, the one
had fine worked muslin curtains tied with
blue, and a muslin dimity quilt fringe;
and in it lay a little doll dressed like a
little boy in a muslin robe, with a laced
rose to his cap, and a blue sash. The
other cradle had pink Persian curtains tied
with white ribbon, and a white sattin quilt
bound with pink ribbon; this contained
a little girl in a muslin robe likewise, with
a pink ribbon round her cap, and a pink
sash round her waist. The goodness of
your behaviour, said Mrs. <i>Grant</i>, I think
entitles you to the privilege of chusing
first; take which you like: Miss <i>Fanny</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
will accept the other; and I dare say she
will not let the puppy come into her
nursery.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> begged leave to let Miss
<i>Fanny</i> chuse first, and pressed her much to
say which she liked best; but she constantly
refused; till after this friendly contest
had lasted some little time, Miss
<i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma told her, it would be
better for her to make a choice, as Miss
<i>Fanny</i> could not be persuaded to determine.</p>

<p>The dear girl had pitied <i>Fanny</i>, and
wished that she should be pleased about
the doll; and as she knew that she very
much preferred the little boy herself, she
naturally thought that <i>Fanny</i> would do so
too, and, therefore, left it for her, and took
the little girl. <i>Fanny</i> then took the boy,
and promised to guard it from puppies,
and all other mischances.</p>

<p>I thought, said the elder Miss <i>Lively</i>,
you were wishing but the other day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a little boy doll. I expected you would
have chosen that?</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> said nothing. But Mrs. <i>Grant</i>,
who guessed her reason, asked <i>Fanny</i> which
she really thought the prettiest? <i>Fanny</i>
thus called upon, said, they were both
pretty; but she thought the little girl the
prettiest. Then pray take it, said <i>Lydia</i>;
for Indeed I left the boy because I
thought you would like it best. And I,
said <i>Fanny</i>, did not like to say any thing,
because I thought my cousin liked the
little girl best.</p>

<p>You are both charming girls, said Mrs.
<i>Grant</i>, but I suppose, if you change, each
will have exactly what she wishes. The exchange
was made, and afterward the young
ladies spent their time till dinner in nursing
their children, and putting them into
and taking them out of the cradle.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> had now quite left off whining
and frowning, and was grown a very
agreeable play-fellow and companion;
and as she and <i>Fanny</i> amused themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
without any noise or bustle, it was a pleasure
to see them in the room. During the
whole time they staid, they behaved in the
most pleasing manner; and Mrs. <i>Grant</i>
did every thing in her power to make
the visit agreeable to them. After passing
a very cheerful day, they returned
home, and Miss <i>Lydia</i> had the pleasure of
seeing her little friend in much better
spirits than when she set out.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE BASKET OVERTURNED.</i></span></h2>

<p>One day, as Miss <i>Lydia</i> was walking in
the fields with her Mamma, her sisters,
and <i>Fanny</i>, she saw a little girl standing
near the hedge, and crying very sadly.
The voice of distress was never heard
without attention by Miss <i>Lydia</i>; she ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up to the girl, followed by <i>Fanny</i>, and
asked her what was the matter?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Girl.</span></p>

<p>Oh! dear, what shall I do! my eggs
are almost all broken! and my mother
will be so angry, I am afraid to go home!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Do not cry, I dare say your mother will
not be very angry: my Mamma would
not, I am sure.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Girl</span> (<i>still sobbing</i>.)</p>

<p>Yes, Miss; but my mother will, and
beat me severely too. I was to have sold
them for a shilling, and carried back some
butter and a loaf.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I dare say you did not break them on
purpose: how did it happen?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Girl.</span></p>

<p>My mother put two dozen of eggs into
this little basket, and wrapped them nicely
up in straw, and bade me go directly to
town with them, and not stop at all. She
told me I must sell them for a shilling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and bring back a loaf and some butter. I
walked straight on till I came to this field,
and then the blackberries looked so nice
in the hedge, that I longed to get some;
and I thought there could be no harm in
stepping to the hedge and gathering a few.
I set my basket down because I wanted to
reach a very fine bough that grew in the
back part of the hedge; but while I was
plucking the fruit, a great over-grown dog
came and ran his nose into my basket,
overturned all the eggs, and broke a
dozen of them; and now I cannot buy
the bread and the butter. My mother
wants them for her tea, and I do not
know what she will do to me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Lively</i> and <i>Lydia</i>’s elder sisters
had now walked up to them, and Mrs.
<i>Lively</i> having overheard the girl’s discourse,
said, I am sorry to see you in
such trouble; but you now find the
consequence of not minding your mother.
Little girls are apt to think they
know as well as their parents; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
generally find themselves mistaken, and
sometimes get into a great deal of distress
by fancying so; as you have done. Your
mother bade you go directly to town and
stop nowhere, because she knew if you
got to play, or gave your attention to any
thing but your eggs, a great many accidents
might happen to break them; and
if you had done as she bade you, it is probable
your eggs would have been safe.
Your mother, therefore, will have great
reason to be angry, when she knows how
the accident happened.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Girl.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Madam, that is what will make
her so angry; she would have forgiven
me a great deal sooner if it had happened
any other way. A boy, who came by just
now, advised me to say, as I was getting
over a stile the bar gave way, and I
tumbled down, and that so my eggs got
broken; but I never did tell her a lie in
my life, and I should be very unwilling
to begin now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lady.</span></p>

<p>Your mother has at least been very kind
to you in instilling such good principles
into you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Girl.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Madam, she always taught me to
be honest, and never tell a lie upon any
account whatever; and if she were to find
out that I deceived her, she would punish
me ten times more than she will now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lady.</span></p>

<p>Be assured you can never escape trouble
and sorrow by being wicked; you have
already done one fault, and you feel how
unhappy it has made you; but, if you
were to tell a lie, you would become a
great deal more naughty, and consequently
be a great deal more unhappy. And
though you were not found out, I dare say
your mother has taught you that God always
sees you; and if you try to save yourself
by wicked means, you put yourself
quite out of the way of his blessing and
protection. Now, you are so good a girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I dare say you will find your mother
kinder to you than you expect. Dry up
your tears, and take this shilling; give
me the eggs that remain, go and buy
your butter and bread, and then your
mother will not be disappointed; and as
you are so good a girl, whenever your
mother has any eggs or chickens, you
may bring them to me, and I will give
you your price for them; only remember
to call at the first white house as you come
into town.</p>

<p>The poor girl received the shilling with
equal joy and gratitude; and when she
was gone, Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma observed
to her, that persons often find a present
reward in doing their duty: If this little
girl, said she, had taken the boy’s advice,
and determined to tell her mother a falsity,
she would probably have turned back
directly, and been in another field when
we came here, so that we should have
known nothing of her distress, and her
story would, perhaps, not have been so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
told as to escape detection. I hope now
the amends I have made for her loss will
abate the severity of her mother’s anger;
and when the whole of her conduct is
known, she must, I think, receive her
praises.</p>

<p>Just as she had done speaking, a beautiful
insect flew by Miss <i>Lydia</i>. Look,
Mamma, said she, that fly is just like the
picture in my book; is it not? We will
look, my dear, said her Mamma: and
taking out of her pocket the <i>Rational
Dame</i>, she found the little creature under
the title of Dragon Fly; and little <i>Lydia</i>
read the description of it, and had afterwards
a full opportunity of admiring it, as
it rested upon a leaf.</p>

<p>I am sure, said <i>Lydia</i>, I am much
obliged to Mrs. <i>Teachwell</i> for writing so
useful a book; it has taught me a great
many things. And me likewise, said her
Mamma; we will never walk out without
it; for the best use we can make of our
walks, is to acquaint ourselves with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
works of God; which in the fields and
lanes are continually before us. And I
wish Mrs. <i>Teachwell</i> would give us some
little system of plants, with their nature
and uses, fit for such young folk as you;
for I again say, you cannot be too well
acquainted with the works of God, who
made you, and made the little insects, and
the slender flower which your eye almost
overlooks. God, my child, has spread
before you two volumes, which are each
his work, and demand and deserve your
most attentive consideration, and most
curious study; the <i>Book of Revelation</i>—I
mean the <i>Bible</i>, wherein you learn the
way to eternal life; and the <i>Book of Nature</i>,
which is every where spread open before
you, and which instructs you every where
in the wisdom and goodness of God. Let
no opportunity slip then of acquainting
yourself with those wonders; and the more
you learn of “What great things God
has done for you;” may your heart feel
more grateful to Him, and more ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
obey Him, and to do every thing He
commands.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE BIRTH-DAY.</i></span></h2>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> had several brothers as well
as sisters, a good deal older than herself;
among the rest was <i>Gilbert</i>, a boy, who
from the goodness of his disposition, seemed
formed to make his parents happy.
Obliging to all, he was particularly indulgent
and kind to little <i>Lydia</i>. One day,
in the autumn, he joined a family party
in the garden, and seeing some fine alpine
strawberries in a little garden which the
elder ones had given to <i>Lydia</i>, he asked her
if he might gather some? No, pray brother,
do not gather them now, said <i>Lydia</i>;
for I keep them to treat you all with to-morrow
upon my birth-day. Is to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
your birth-day, little girl? replied
he; then, as to-day is a half-holiday, I
will go a fishing, and try if I cannot get
you a dish of fish for your dinner. I shall
set off directly: and pray, Mamma, do
not mind whether I return to dinner, for
I do not care about that. Go then, said
Mamma; and I will contribute some tarts
and a cake, as my share of the entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert</i> took his rod and his implements,
and away he went. At dinner he was not
much expected; but in the evening his
Mamma began to grow uneasy, and was
going to send a servant after him. However,
just as she was speaking to the
servant, <i>Gilbert</i> came in much tired, but
without any fish.</p>

<p>I am sorry, <i>Lydia</i>, said he, not to have
any fish to offer you; but I think when
you know how it happened, you will not
be displeased with me. I had, said he,
no success at all till evening; the fish
then began to bite, and I caught two very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fine trout. I was coming home mightily
delighted with my prize; but before I
had walked a quarter of a mile, I heard the
sound of somebody crying on the other
side of the hedge, and heard a voice say,
Now your brothers and sisters must go to-bed
without their suppers; and poor things,
I left them only a halfpenny roll in the
morning; and we had nothing, you know,
but a few turnips yesterday.</p>

<p>The hedge was so thick I could not see
who was speaking, till we came to a stile,
and then I saw the poor boy (who comes
to the door sometimes with fish) and his
mother get over into the lane. I asked
her, what was the matter? and she told me,
she had been about five miles to buy fish;
that she had almost starved herself and her
children to save up two shillings for the
purpose, in hope of getting a little profit
by it; she had staid all day, and could not
get any; and she and her son were returning
home. She had a hole in her pocket,
and, therefore, had given the shillings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the boy; and as they were going through
a close lane, she unguardedly said to her
son, <i>Bob</i>, are your two shillings safe?
Just at that moment a great, big man
jumped over the hedge, and catching hold
of the boy, said, Are you quite sure they are
safe? let me take care of them for you;
and then ran his hand into his pocket, and
took away the two shillings: and now,
said she, I have nothing to give to the children!
I intended to have bought a six-penny
loaf, when I got home, for this boy
and I have tasted nothing to-day; and I
should have tried to get some fish to-morrow
with the remaining eighteen-pence.
She cried so, added <i>Gilbert</i>, that I
was ready to cry too. I had no money
to give her. I had nothing but my fish;
and I asked her, how much she could sell
them for? O! dear Sir! said she, they
are very fine fish! I dare say they would
fetch a shilling or eighteen-pence a piece.
And do you think you could sell them to-night
if you had them? said I. She said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
she did not doubt that she could sell
them; but should not think of taking my
fish: however, I begged her to take them;
and if it had not been so late, I would
have gone back and tried to get you some
more, <i>Lydia</i>; but I will get up very early
in the morning and go. Indeed, brother,
said <i>Lydia</i>, I beg you will not think of it;
for if there are such bad men about they
may rob you too.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert</i>, I believe, said Mamma, does
not read <i>Horace</i> yet, or he might tell you
that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Blythe sings the traveller with empty purse,</div>
<div class="verse">And in the robber’s sight pursues his course.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But though it is certain that, if he has
nothing he cannot be robbed, he may be
uncivilly used, and, therefore, I would
advise him not to go; we can, I dare say,
procure fish without giving him any further
trouble; but I thought you had a
shilling this morning, <i>Gilbert</i>; what have
you done with it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span></p>

<p>Pray, Mamma, do not ask me; it is a
secret at present.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Then I never desire to know secrets;
and you, I am persuaded, will do nothing
wrong; and as I have no anxiety upon
that account, I should be ashamed, if
mere curiosity made me desirous to know
what you wish to conceal. Nothing, I
think, is so contemptible as that sort of
curiosity, which makes people want to
know what every one says and does, and
which grows more impatient in proportion
as we think the person wishes us not to
know.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span></p>

<p>Nay, Mamma, I have no real secrets
from you, only I wish nobody to know
just now—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I am quite satisfied, my dear boy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I have a little secret, Mamma; my sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
told me you would not be angry, and nobody
knows but her:—do not tell yet,
<i>Kitty</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I dare say she will not, my love; and
if she were going I would not let her.
You heard me say, I never desire to know
secrets. I think no wise person would;
but I should be very sorry any body belonging
to me should not be able to keep
a secret, if they were intrusted with one.
But I will tell you something that is no
secret; which is, that your long walk
has tired you; and that you look very
sleepy; therefore, I advise you to go to-bed.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert</i> waked soon in the morning; and
as the sun shone very bright, and it was a
delightful morning, he longed to take his
fishing-rod once more; but his Mamma having
desired him not, he did not attempt it;
but before he went to school he went with
his violin to <i>Lydia</i>’s door, and waked her
with a very cheerful tune, wished her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
many happy birth-days, and then went
away. <i>Lydia</i> arose as soon as the maid
came into her room, and went to receive
a kiss from her Mamma; she then walked
down stairs, and the first thing she saw at
the hall door was her little lamb, with a
new blue ribbon round his neck, and shaking
some little round bells that were fastened
to it. Away she flew first to her
Mamma, then to her sisters, to ask who
had made her lamb so fine? but they could
not give her any information; every body
in the house was asked to no purpose.
After a little while, I think, said Mamma—I
guess! I guess too, cried out little
<i>Lydia</i>, it must be <i>Gilbert</i>; you know he
said he had a secret; that is it depend
upon it: how kind it was of him! how
dearly I do love <i>Gilbert</i>! Every body
must love him dearly, said his Mamma. I
wish, said <i>Lydia</i>, I knew how to make him
some return. I wish I could do any thing
to please him.—Your wish is natural and
amiable; but be satisfied, that <i>Gilbert</i> finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the performance of such acts of good-nature
and kindness, a higher reward than
any we could give him; believe me there is
a delight in being kind, and affectionate,
and generous, that is beyond any pleasure
that relates merely to a person’s own self;
and if the most ill-tempered and selfish
person in the world would but determine
for one month to say nothing but
what was kind; and to be always doing
obliging and liberal things, he would find
himself so much more comfortable, so
much better, not only in mind but in
health; and so much more easy and satisfied
with himself, that mere self-love would
make him continue such a conduct.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted even with seeing my
little lamb happy, when I feed and caress
him. I think it is a great pleasure to have
the power of making any thing happy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Cherish, my dearest child, this disposition,
and these feelings; and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should ever meet with unkindness from
others, do not let that incline you to be
less kind and good. Bear always in your
mind the text I once taught you, “Be
not overcome of evil; but overcome evil
with good.” And if you see persons by
their ill-temper offend God, and vex every
body they are connected with, instead
of making their bad behaviour an excuse
for your own, think what a sad thing it
would be if you, seeing the disagreeableness
of their behaviour, were to become
like them; and on the contrary, think
what an honour it will be to you, if, by
your example, by seeing you always patient,
and kind, and disinterested, others
leave off disputes and selfishness, and grow
good.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Here comes the dear <i>Gilbert</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Here he comes; and I am sure you
both feel far more joy than the mere
spending of a shilling could have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
you; and the older you grow the more
I trust you will know and understand of
that kind of joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE SECRET EXPLAINED.</i></span></h2>

<p>While Miss <i>Lydia</i> was at work with
her Mamma, a servant came in, and said,
a little girl and boy at the gate asked for
Miss <i>Lydia</i>. <i>Lydia</i> coloured; and upon her
Mamma’s asking who they were? said,
with great eagerness, It is little <i>Sally</i> and
her brother, Madam: may I go down to
them? Pray let me go by myself? You
shall see the little girl before she goes
home.</p>

<p>Mamma’s consent was soon obtained,
and <i>Lydia</i>, having first stepped into her
room, and hastily taken a little bundle out
of the drawer, flew down stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>When she got to the gate, she saw
<i>Sally</i> holding a pretty little basket made
of rushes, with little tufts of silk at the
four corners, and covered at top with
green leaves.</p>

<p>As soon as <i>Sally</i> saw Miss <i>Lydia</i>, she
presented the basket to her, and told her,
that the maid, who had bidden her to come
to the house this morning, told her it was
Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s birth-day; and she had made
that basket, and taken the liberty to bring
it to her.</p>

<p>It is a very pretty basket, indeed,
said Miss <i>Lydia</i>; and lifting up the leaves
on the top, she saw the basket was almost
full of little cakes and lozenges, and on
them Sally had put some bunches of services.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Where did you get all these things,
<i>Sally</i>? I will not take them from you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sally.</span></p>

<p>Yes, pray do Miss, I brought them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
purpose for you. My mother makes the
cakes and the lozenges herself, and sells
them; and my brother and I were out all
yesterday afternoon to look for services on
the hedges; and then I made the basket
and put them into it; and I shall be very
sorry if you will not accept of it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>You made that pretty basket, <i>Sally</i>! I
wish you would teach me to make such
nice baskets.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sally.</span></p>

<p>That I will with great pleasure, Miss,
if your Mamma likes it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for your nice
present. I have something for you, <i>Sally</i>;
and that is the reason why I sent for you
to come to-day. So saying, <i>Lydia</i> opened
the band-box, and took out a new straw
hat, with a nice green ribbon round the
crown, and one small neat bow behind,
and green strings to tie it. <i>Lydia</i> desired
the little girl to pull off her own hat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then sit down and let her put this on:
nor had <i>Sally</i> more delight in being thus
dressed, than <i>Lydia</i> had in dressing her.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> then went again to her box, and
took out a very pretty cotton frock, which
she put on the little boy, with more pleasure
than she had ever dressed a doll;
though the little fellow was not quite so
quiet as a doll, but was moving and twisting
about to see as much as possible of
the flowers upon his frock.</p>

<p>When their things were adjusted, Miss
<i>Lydia</i> led them to the door, and desired
her Mamma to step down.</p>

<p>Mamma, said she, I told you I had a
secret; this is it. I read in the <i>Children’s
Friend</i>, that people should do some good-action
on their birth-day. Do you like
<i>Sally</i>’s hat, Mamma?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Yes, my dear, it is very neat indeed:
but where did you get these things? you
could not buy them yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>No, Mamma, my sister was so good as
to get the hat and the ribbon for me
when she went to school, and to put the
ribbon on for me. I have been saving
up my money a great while. Do not you
remember I would not buy a basket when
the others did? and look now what a
pretty basket <i>Sally</i> has brought me! a
great deal prettier than that at the door.
Still I should not have had money enough
if my aunt had not happened to give me a
shilling the other day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>But where did you get the frock?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Do not you remember the piece of cotton
Miss <i>Friend</i> gave me to make my
great doll a gown? My sister said, there
was enough to make the little boy a frock,
and she was so good as to cut it out and fit
it for me, and I made it up myself.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>It is very nicely made, I am sure; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you, my love, are a proof of what I was
saying just now, of the pleasure there is in
doing kind actions; you appear so cheerful
and satisfied. I am sure you never had
half so much enjoyment of a new hat for
yourself or a fine doll.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Because the little boy and girl look so
happy; and there is so much pleasure in
seeing people happy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>Blessed indeed are those whose countenances,
like a mirror, reflect the brightness
which shines in the face of their
neighbour: or, to speak more plainly, my
little dear, blessed both of God and man
are those who are cheerful and happy, because
they see another person glad; “Who
rejoice with them that do rejoice.” But,
my dear, your little friends, I dare say,
are impatient to show the presents to their
mother: you had better dismiss them.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i>, who had now learned to mind
her Mamma the moment she spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
thanked <i>Sally</i> for her pretty basket, and
told her she must come one day and teach
her to make such; and then desired them
to go home.</p>

<p><i>Sally</i> made a dozen courtesies, and the
little boy as many bows; and thanked her
again and again as they went away.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i> then put away her basket
with cakes, saying, that should make part
of the feast in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A half holiday had been procured for
<i>Gilbert</i>, so that he joined the cheerful
circle at dinner; and in the afternoon
some young folk were expected to tea.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i>, therefore, was abundantly
busy in setting out cakes, fruit, &amp;c. amidst
which <i>Sally</i>’s little basket was introduced,
and was to <i>Lydia</i> the most agreeable part of
the entertainment, as it was connected with
the remembrance of a benevolent action.
As she was not big enough to cut the
large cake which her Mamma had provided,
one of her brother’s very obligingly
cut some slices for her, which she offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to the company with great politeness and
propriety.</p>

<p>Just before tea, a servant brought in a
little box, and delivered it to Miss <i>Lydia</i>;
she looked, and saw it directed to her,
and very eagerly set about opening it;
this was very easily effected, as the nails
were not driven very tight; and on lifting
up the lid, the first thing she saw was hay,
that being removed, she found a complete
set of doll’s tea-china, a tea board, an urn,
a tea-chest, a waiter, a pair of tea-tongs, and
half a dozen spoons; with a little note to
tell her, that these were the joint presents
of her elder brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Here was a fresh scene of pleasure to
the sweet girl: her presents were shown
to every body; were admired; and her
delight expressed in the warmest manner,
yet not so as to importune or disturb any
body by her joy.</p>

<p>The tea-chest was then filled with tea,
the sugar-bason with sugar, the urn with
water, and Miss <i>Lydia</i> made tea in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
composed and becoming manner. The
evening was passed in cheerful and inoffensive
amusement, where the chief contest
was, who should please and oblige
the other most.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>THE AGREEABLE TOUR.</i></span></h2>

<p>When Miss <i>Fanny</i> had been two
months with her aunt, her Mamma returned
from her journey, and came to fetch
her.</p>

<p>Not only Miss <i>Fanny</i>, but the rest of
the family, were rejoiced to see her: the
young persons asked her many questions;
whither she had been? and what she had
seen?</p>

<p>She was ready to answer all their inquiries
with great good-humour; and
taking out a book of pocket-maps, said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I will show you the route I have been.
We set out, you know, from <i>Berkshire</i>.
We went through <i>Oxfordshire</i>, stopped at
<i>Oxford</i>, and there, Miss <i>Lydia</i>, saw your
brother, who shewed us the university,
and entertained us with great politeness.</p>

<p>We likewise passed through <i>Woodstock</i>;
and I have brought each of you a pair of
gloves; a manufacture for which you
know <i>Woodstock</i> is famous.</p>

<p>We then proceeded through <i>Warwickshire</i>,
<i>Staffordshire</i>, <i>Cheshire</i>, <i>Lancashire</i>,
<i>Westmoreland</i>, <i>Cumberland</i>, and <i>Northumberland</i>,
where Fanny, your father’s business
was.</p>

<p>As we returned, we came by <i>Durham</i>,
<i>Yorkshire</i>, <i>Derbyshire</i>, <i>Lincolnshire</i>, <i>Huntingdonshire</i>,
and <i>Hertfordshire</i>.</p>

<p>I have brought my little niece and
<i>Fanny</i> a set of doll’s plates and dishes,
from <i>Staffordshire</i>, and a piece of muslin
dimity, for gowns for my elder cousins,
from <i>Manchester</i>, in <i>Lancashire</i>; where we
stopped a whole day, to see the very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
manufacture that is carrying on there, of
cottons, dimities, muslins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>While we were in <i>Lancashire</i>, we went
to <i>Ancliff</i> near <i>Wigan</i>, to see the famous
burning well.</p>

<p>The water of this well is cold, and has
no smell, yet there is so strong a vapour
of sulphur issuing out with the stream, that
upon applying a light to it, the top of the
water is covered with a flame, like that
of burning spirits, which lasts several
hours, and emits so fierce a heat, that
meat may be boiled over it. The fluid
itself will not burn when taken out of the
well.</p>

<p>In <i>Cumberland</i> we saw the black-lead
mine, from whence your pencils, young
gentlemen, are furnished, which have assisted
you in adorning my dressing-room
with such handsome drawings.</p>

<p>While we staid in <i>Northumberland</i>, we
went to see the coal-pits, from whence we
who live in the southern countries are
supplied: the cargoes are shipped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<i>Newcastle upon Tyne</i>, which is also famous
for its fishery of Salmon.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen, I hope, will accept
of a pair of shoe-buckles from <i>Birmingham</i>,
in <i>Warwickshire</i>, and the ladies of
a pair of scissors from <i>Sheffield</i>, in <i>Yorkshire</i>;
both places are famous for the manufacture
of hard-ware.</p>

<p>While we were in <i>Derbyshire</i>, we went
to see the dropping-well near <i>Buxton</i>:
which gives the appearance of stone to
every thing that is put into it; and I
have brought you some petrifactions from
thence.</p>

<p>One day we spent at <i>Buxton</i>, and saw
the company who go to drink the medicinal
waters there.</p>

<p>We likewise went to see <i>Poole’s Hole</i>,
by <i>Buxton</i>; but of that you will find a
better account than I can give you in
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, written by a
gentleman who went with a party to visit
it.</p>

<p>I have brought your Mamma, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<i>Lydia</i>, some ornaments for her mantle-piece,
made of Derbyshire spar; and an
egg of that substance for your sister
<i>Caroline</i>’s netting: the spar is said to be
water petrified as it drops through rocks,
and to take the variety of its colours from
the different metals or minerals it passes
through.</p>

<p>I have likewise brought a carpet for
your papa’s study, from <i>Kidderminster</i>, in
<i>Worcestershire</i>, which, I think, he will
not esteem inferior to the Turkey carpets,
which we fetch from so far.</p>

<p>From <i>Dunstable</i> in <i>Bedfordshire</i> I have
brought a set of little tea-things, some
work-baskets, and some toys for the young
folk, all made of straw, like your hat, Miss
<i>Lydia</i>. And now, perhaps, I have tired
you by talking, and you will be better
pleased with seeing all my collection.</p>

<p>The young people listened with great
attention to the lady. Soon after she
produced her treasures, and desired them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to recollect the place from whence each
came.</p>

<p>They acquitted themselves very well,
and were not deficient in proper thanks
to their aunt, for her kind attention to
them.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards Miss <i>Fanny</i>
and her Mamma took their leave; not
without mutual regret on the part of Miss
<i>Lydia</i> and Miss <i>Fanny</i>, who were most
affectionately attached to each other.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.<br />
<span class="smaller gesperrt"><i>GENEROSITY AND GRATITUDE.</i></span></h2>

<p>Sometime after Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s cousin
<i>Fanny</i> had left her, little <i>Lydia</i>, on her
return from a walk with the maid, ran, all
in tears, into her Mamma’s room; and
told her, that little <i>Sally</i>’s mother was in
very great distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>She owes, Mamma, four guineas to Mr.
<i>Flint</i> for living in his house; and because
she has not money to pay him, he is
going to take every thing she has, and
turn her into the street. The poor woman
and children were crying so sadly
when I went by the door, that it made
me quite uncomfortable, as Miss <i>Seymour</i>
says, to see them.</p>

<p>The poor woman said, she and her
children must go into the workhouse.
The little girl was crying to see her mother
cry; and the boy said, they would
take away his rabbit, and his little chair
in which he used to sit by the fire-side.
Do, pray, Mamma, do something for the
poor woman. Perhaps, if you speak to
Mr. <i>Flint</i> he will not take her things.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>My dear love, I know Mr. <i>Flint</i> better
than you do: it is not possible to persuade
him to forego his money; and as
to assisting her with four guineas, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
more than I can well spare; besides, you
know there are many people in distress
as well as she.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps so: but I have seen this poor
woman and the children cry so! and the
little ones have been so civil to me!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>I am sincerely sorry for them.—Why
do you look so earnestly at me, <i>Lydia</i>?—Have
you any money at all?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>No, Mamma; I have no money; but
you know, Mamma, you were going to
buy me a pink silk slip, to wear under my
muslin frock. What would that have
cost?—I can do very well with my dimity
ones.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>My dearest girl! come to my arms,
and enjoy a pleasure you so richly deserve!
that of making the poor people happy.
Your slip would not have cost two guineas,
so that sacrifice alone would not do; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you have set me a noble example; and I
will also give up a carpet which I intended
to buy for my dressing-room; and the
price of that added to the other, will be
sufficient to redeem Mrs. <i>Brush</i>’s goods,
and set her mind at ease.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>My dear Mamma! I am so glad! Then
I may go directly with the money?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mamma.</span></p>

<p>We will go together. You would be
at a loss by yourself. Go, pray, and ask
for my great-coat and my gloves.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i> flew like lightening; and her
Mamma being soon equipped, they hastened
to Mrs. <i>Brush</i>.</p>

<p>The first thing they saw, was all her
little scholars turned out of the room, and
in a heap before the door crying.</p>

<p>When they went in, they found every
thing pulled out of its place: a rough
looking man had dragged her bedstead
down stairs; and the little boy stood with
his eyes fixed upon him, and sobbing said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
What must mammy and I do for a bed?
I am sure Mr. <i>Flint</i> does not want this:
he has got a great many fine beds.</p>

<p>Upon being asked where his mammy
was? he said in the garden. As they
were passing through to go to her, they
saw another man just going to pull her
little copper down. Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s Mamma
begged he would desist a little while, and
he should not be a loser by it. She then
went on; at the further end of the garden
they saw the little girl and her mother in
an arbour, which they had taken great
pains to adorn with roses and honeysuckles;
and in which they were now sitting,
as they supposed, for the last time:
they were weeping bitterly. The little
girl’s eyes were fixed on the parrot, which
hung on a tree near them, and which
seemed to take part with them, by crying
every minute, Poor Poll! What’s the
matter?</p>

<p>The Lady and her daughter went on
towards them; but as they were walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a young woman entered the garden hastily,
and rushing by them, ran up to the woman,
and catching hold of her arm, with
great affection said, Thank God, cousin!
I am come just in time! As soon as ever
I heard you were in trouble, I left my
place; and what with my wages, and the
money I have raised upon my cloaths, I
have been able to bring you enough to
pay your rent. Take the four guineas,
and let us get these frightful people out
of the house.</p>

<p>The good woman looked very much
amazed, and was silent for a moment;
then again bursting into tears; God forbid,
my dear <i>Jenny</i>! said she, that I should strip
you. No, I can bear my own troubles;
but I could never support the thought,
that I had taken your bread out of your
mouth. How could you think of leaving
your place? so good a one as you had:
and what have you done with your cloaths?
I never thought I should be the occasion
of doing you so much harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>While these two friends were talking
thus, the Lady and her daughter came
up to them. The unfortunate woman, in
the midst of her trouble, did not neglect
to pay them proper respect: the young
person stopped to make them a courtesy,
and then earnestly went on. Never think
about me, I am young, and can get my
living; and after all you have done for
me, I should be the most ungrateful creature
in the world did I not assist you.
If it had not been for you, I should not
have been alive now; or, if I had, I
should have been in a workhouse. When
I was ill with that fever, you nursed me,
laid me in your own bed, and sat up with
me yourself, to tend me; and then paid
my doctor’s bill, that I might not be
obliged to sell my cloaths: and have not
you the best right to them?</p>

<p>I a right! no, indeed said her cousin.</p>

<p>Surely you have, returned she: the
money you spent upon me would have
paid almost two years rent; and now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
who lived so neatly, and so comfortably,
are going to be pulled all to pieces. You
will break my heart if you do not take
the money: but why should I stand arguing
with you, when I can go and pay the
money myself. So saying, she was hastening
out of the garden; when Miss <i>Lydia</i>’s
Mamma catching hold of her, said, I was
unwilling to interrupt so generous a dispute,
and I waited a little to see what
would be the end of it: but as to the
rent, my daughter and I came on purpose
to discharge it. Receive from my daughter
(Mrs. <i>Brush</i>) four guineas, which we
were going to spend otherwise; but upon
nothing that would have given us half
the pleasure which we feel in putting you
in possession of your house again. As to
you, young woman, your conduct is above
all reward from man; and yet I wish—</p>

<p>It was impossible for the Lady to go
on; the joy and gratitude of these worthy
people quite overpowered her; and the
only way she could get rid of their thanks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was by hurrying them into the house, to
secure all the goods.</p>

<p>When the rent was discharged, and the
men sent away, Mrs. <i>Brush</i> and her cousin
were able to converse more composedly
with their benefactors. The former, in
the midst of her joy, expressed great concern
that her cousin had thrown herself out
of place; and asked, with great anxiety,
what she had done with her cloaths?</p>

<p>The young woman said, she could not
rest a moment, after she heard from an
acquaintance, who called upon her, that
her landlord was very cruel to her; and
that she expected every day to have her
goods seized for rent. That she, therefore,
went directly to her mistress, and
told her, that a relation in the country
wanted her very much, and begged to be
discharged.</p>

<p>She would not tell her the whole story
for fear she should oppose her intentions;
and as to asking leave to go out for a time,
she could not expect to return to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
place, when she had disposed of all her
cloaths.</p>

<p>Her mistress appeared displeased; but
paid her her wages, which was about a
guinea: that she then sold some of her
cloaths, and pawned the rest to raise the
remainder, and as much as would pay her
passage from <i>London</i>; however, as to her
cloaths, she said, she had not a doubt
but she could get them again; for the woman
who took them was a very good sort
of woman, and indeed could hardly be
persuaded to receive them of her.</p>

<p>And do you think, Mrs. <i>Jenny</i>, said the
Lady, your mistress could not be prevailed
on to take you again? Surely, if she knew
the whole truth, she would think herself
happy in such a servant.</p>

<p>It is not probable she should have got
another in so short a time. You shall
return as soon as you can; and I will
send a letter by you to the lady you have
left, to inform her from what generous
motives you left her so abruptly. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
take my leave of you both now; and in
an hour’s time the letter shall be ready.</p>

<p>The young woman called at the time
mentioned for the letter; and after many
expressions of gratitude for the kindness
shown to her cousin and herself, returned
to <i>London</i>, carried it to her late mistress,
and in a few days, Miss <i>Lydia</i> had the
pleasure of knowing, that her Mamma had
received a letter from the lady, to thank
her for restoring so valuable a servant to
her, and to inform her, that as her own
maid was going to be married, she meant
to take her to wait upon herself; and
should ever esteem a person capable of
such noble conduct, rather as a friend than
a servant.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="gesperrt"><i>CONCLUSION.</i></span></h2>

<p>Miss <i>Lydia</i>, when her Mamma first began
to write down an account of her behaviour
throughout the day, was so much
alarmed, lest the story should not be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
her credit, that she never went to sleep,
without endeavouring to recollect how she
had passed the day, and whether she had
been good or not. When her conscience
told her of any fault, her concern for it
naturally led her to consider how she
might have avoided that fault, and how
she ought to have behaved. In the morning,
likewise, when she awoke, the journal
was the first thing that came into her
mind; and she used to think what business
she had to do that day, and what faults
she was in the most danger of committing;
particularly if she had done any thing
wrong the day before, she always considered
how she should conduct herself so
as not to have the same sad story told of
her again.</p>

<p>Her Mamma, when she found those faults
thoroughly corrected, which were her first
motive for writing an account of her
daughter’s conduct, discontinued her journal;
but <i>Lydia</i> had so accustomed herself
to the above mentioned inquiry, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
still continued so excellent a practice; and
nothing so much assisted her, in her wish
to be good, as this habit; for by such a
frequent review of her behaviour, she discovered
many little faults, which she would
not otherwise have noticed; and by correcting
them in the beginning, she escaped
falling into many vices and bad habits,
which, though very easily checked at first,
become, after they are long indulged,
very difficult to break. I very affectionately
recommend this practice to any
young persons who desire in earnest to be
good: and if the little anecdotes I have
written shall persuade any one little boy or
girl to correct their faults, and become
more happy in themselves, and a greater
comfort to their parents, I shall be abundantly
recompensed for my trouble.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
